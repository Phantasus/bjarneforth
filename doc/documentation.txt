Documentation of Bootforth
--------------------------

The documentation of bootforth
is splitted into different files
in this directory(doc) and the
source documentation.

Sometimes you will find in the 
documentation files(the files in 
the doc directory) stuff which
is also documented in the source,
that's for redundancy.


Source Documentation
--------------------

You can find documentation 
related to structures, constants
defines and macros in the headerfiles.

Documentation about each function
can be found in the .c files.
There you have comments which have the
word 'DOC:' in here, which means that the
comment is a documentation comment, which
describes the function.

There is a speciality for forth primitives,
which are the stack comments and the fname comments.

/* ( before -- after ) */
The stack comment is a comment which shows you the
stack effect before and after an operation, normally
they affect the data stack(dstack) but when explicitly
mentioned in the comment the operation can also affect 
other stacks.

/* fname: name */
A fname comment is just a hint for you how that primitive
is normally called in Forth, that's also the reason why 
it's called fname(forth name)

Means return stack

argfield
Is the value of the argfield of a word
