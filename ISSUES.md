Issues
------ 

This file contains a list of all project issues.
No issues are deleted, it is intended to be a simple
bug/issuetracker.

Each line contains the issue number, followed by
its description. New issues are prepended to the list,
so that the first issue is at the bottom and the last
defined at the top of this file.

In a commit message, each issue is referenced by the
prefix ISS+NUMBER+:. Where _NUMBER_ is the issue
number of this file. Multiple commits can belong to
the same issue, why? Because splitting a large
problem into small commits is in my opinion a good 
idea.

Currently known issues:

2. Documenting the many years untouched source code.

1. Updating license comments so that it represents 
   the reality again.
