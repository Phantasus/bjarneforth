Install, well no..
------------------

First bootforth(when you know a better name, contact me(damn! normally 
I have freaky names in my head for stuff, but when it comes to forth
I don't have great ones in my mind)) is a FRAMEWORK a kit, perhaps 
a library for putting together your own small forth system. 
Which ISN'T FAST but for testing your ideas and IT'S SMALL. 
So no application to install.

Secondly it has some samples(well, one at the moment, sorry)
for an interpreter.. So there isn't a main.c in the working
directory. You just get into the samples directory and build
the the version which you want through executing the specific
Makefile with 'make` and then you got the result. That's all.
