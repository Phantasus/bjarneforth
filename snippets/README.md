README for Snippets
-------------------

This directory contains snippets for your inspiration.
The source code is under the GPLv3 or later. 

Before it was under the BSD, but as I changed my mind about 
taking the specific code and placing it 1:1 in a product, 
I now think, that this is actually intellectual fraud and 
this isn't what this was originally intended for. 
And also I didn't know about the advertising clause of the BSD
license as I didn't read it. 

Just use it as an inspiration.
