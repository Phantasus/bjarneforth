Basically taking on again of the stuff, which I almost again abandoned.
This code was lying around, I tried to get it running again and then was not very happy
about how it was structured, especially as this is supposed to be some kind of portfolio
application, which reminds me of past greatness.

In the meantime a couple of things have changed and type conversions are not so appreciated
anymore as they were back then more common.

So I need to do a bigger refactor of this project! Yikes!
